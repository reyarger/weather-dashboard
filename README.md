Creating a weather forecast using jquery, DOM manipluation, ajax apis, CSS, & HTML.

## Description 

In this project, I worked with ajax api calls and jquery in order to generate a weather dashboard application. By linking to the weather api, I was able to create an interface that allows the user to search for a particular city & returns a concise weather summary.
